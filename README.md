# My Experiences
## Data Scientist at ValU:
* Optimizing marketing campaigns by segmenting customer base through advanced clustering techniques.
* Enhancing chatbot performance by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.
* Developing a liveness detection model for fraud prevention, capable of distinguishing between real and spoofed images with high accuracy.
* Architecting a comprehensive taxonomy for ValU's merchant database, enabling intelligent search functionality within the app.
* Building a Recommender System to effectively match customers with relevant merchants, increasing engagement and satisfaction.

## Data Scientist at Dell Technologies:
* Contributed to the development of an internal portal equipped with
dashboards and analytics derived from the extracted metadata,
empowering technical advisors to make data-driven decisions.
* Utilized BERT and topic modeling to analyze millions of research
documents and extract valuable insights and research trends in the
technology domain.
* Applied forecasting models to guide R&D, investments, and boost profits
in areas like technology life cycle prediction, classification, and time series
correlation and causation.
* Developed a model to extract entities and relationships between them,
populating a knowledge base for taxonomy creation.
* Created a model to summarize transcripts, improving efficiency using a
quantized Llama 2 model.
* Built an automated AI and GenAI Newsletter pipeline that generates
statistical analysis of the collected papers and summarizes the most
important papers and deploying it to be sent on a monthly basis to a set of
direct recipients from the CTO to enable continuous monitoring of the AI
research field.
* Spearheaded exploration of graph embeddings and pioneered application
of Node2Vec technique within the team, enabling the discovery of hidden
relationships and correlations among companies.
* Leveraged AutoGen for easy creation of next-gen LLM applications based
on multi-agent conversations and integrating LangChain with it for time
series narrative generation and summarization.
### Other responsibilities:
* Helped design Technical Interview Process & conducting interviews.
* Participated in preparing the annual hackathon conducted by Dell
Technologies, targeting students and professionals covering areas as
steganography, security, and machine learning.
* Conducted several workshops to demystify Data Science to Dell
Technologies employees and hosting a competition for the trainees.
* Volunteered as a data science mentor for graduation projects for 5
different universities in Egypt under the AI Empower Egypt Initiative
between Dell Technologies, MCIT (Ministry of Communications and
Information Technology), and universities.

## Part-time Research Assistant at the American University in Cairo:
* Carried out in-depth study on O-RAN to grasp its structure, functioning,
and future growth potential.
* Utilized Reinforcement Learning techniques to address complex problems
in the network, such as load balancing, thereby optimizing network
performance and efficiency.
* Stayed updated with the latest advancements in O-RAN and
Reinforcement Learning to ensure the relevance and applicability of
research work.

## Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Corporatica:
* Engaged in NLP tasks like Intent Classification, Slot Filling, and used
OpenAi's GPT-3 API to construct a retail chatbot assistant.
* Developed an API using ONNX for real-time video matting, including
support for processing input videos.
* Constructed an API for real-time video super-resolution operations.
* Developed an API by comparing Meta's BlenderBot2, SeeKeR, and
BlenderBot3 models to use the most effective one for creating a precise
chatbot.
